# Meeting

Chair: Otte

Minute: Ojas

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Sufficient/Good

Feedback:

- Agenda was added on time.
- Agenda is generally OK, but it needs to be even more detailed. Your estimates were also not right, which led to a lot of time left at the end.  


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- The agreements were concrete and everything was clear. There were also no unnecessary detail.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Great lead - nice that you stopped the bug discussion in order to continue following the agenda.
- The chair generally followed the agenda and everything was discussed in an appropriate amount of time.
- The agenda was not that much filled in, though. This led to some discussions that were not planned and a lot of time left at the end of the meeting.

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- Atmosphere in your team seems really productive. Everyone is actively participating in the meetings and almost everyone is sharing their thoughts.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Although some bugs are present, you had significant progress for these two weeks. Keep tha pace, and you will be good.
- Make sure to update the README file, if I need to do anything special in order to run your application.
- As I've said before, look through all the rubrics - not only the backlog, as "Implemented Features" is only 25% of your grade.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient/Good

Feedback:

- Some of you did not do anything this past two weeks so be sure to contribute more in the following weeks. At the very least, make sure to meet ALL the knockout criteria.
- Other than that, the division of tasks seems fine.
