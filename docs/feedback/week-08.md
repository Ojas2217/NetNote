# Meeting

Chair: Sander

Minute: Otte

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Agenda is generally good, but some of the talking points had too little time allocated. For example, you only put 2 mins for discussing bugs, but you talked a lot about them.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- All agreements are there with no unnecessary detail.
- I could also easily see from the notes what everyone was supposed to do through the week.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- Chair was actively leading the meeting while also leaving room for input from the others. He also had a clear plan on how would the meeting be organised.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- Great atmosphere as usual! Some of you are still pretty quiet though, so maybe work on that.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Sufficient/Good

Feedback:

- You should work on removing bugs from your application and making sure that you meet all the basic requirements. Only after that you should focus on the extra features.
- You seem to have progress since the last time I ran your application though.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Some of you still need lines on the server side.
- Other than that, work distribution seems ok. I could see from your notes that everyone was assigned tasks to do, and you seem to have reached your goals.
