# Meeting

Chair: Kaan
Minute: Quinten

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Agenda was a lot late since it was uploaded tha same day of the meeting. It is important to upload it on time, so that I (and everyone else) have time to prepare.
- However, agenda had clear points. I would advise you to put more sub-points like in the "Discuss Tasks and Planning part of the assessment design" talking point. This will make your agenda even more detailed.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Clear agreements, without any unnecessary details. If someone had missed the meeting, it would have been easy for them to understand what had happened.
- Just don't forget to start taking notes from the beginning in the future, because few talking points are missed :)
- Tip: Put what everyone will be doing this week, so you can check their progress easily in the following week.

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Very Good/Excellent

Feedback:

- Really constructive meeting. Good that you meet beforehand - it makes the overall atmosphere friendly. 
- I heard different ideas from almost all of you, which was also nice.
- Otte, you were a bit quieter than the others. Don't be afraid to give your opinion.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Very Good

Feedback:

- You are on the right track. You already have met most of the basic criteria. 
- Just make sure to reed all the other rubrics as well since the product is not the only thing graded.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Very Good

Feedback:

- Seems equal, good that everyone said what they did at the beginning.
- Some of you seem to have more overview over certain things. If someone has trouble understanding parts of the project, make sure to consult with the others. 
- Summary at the end was really nice!
