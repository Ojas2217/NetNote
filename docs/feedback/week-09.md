# Meeting

Chair: Vilius

Minutes: Kaan

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- Everything is detailed and I knew what to expect from the meeting. Nice job!

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Notes were added in time and are detailed enough.
- The only thing is that they seem pretty chaotic to me. Issues and Plan have some overlapping points and the title "Side-notes" doesn't give enough information.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Chair was really well-prepared as the agenda was very detailed.
- Chair was in the lead of the meeting, while also leaving room for input from the others.
- The only thing that the chair can improve is their starting of the meetings. A lot of questions were asked before opening the meeting.
- Also, maybe try to speak a little bit louder when you are leading :)
- Also, the meeting became pretty chaotic at the end as you were just coming up with random rubrics to improve.
