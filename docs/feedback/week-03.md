# Meeting

Chair: Ojas
Minute: Vilius

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Overall, the agenda is great but there are few things worth mentioning:
    - "Create an agenda for the next friday meeting" is a bit unrealistic to do in 2 minutes.
    - Use sub-points to make the talking points more detailed. For example, here: "Discuss the issues created last friday", it would be helpful to mention what issues exactly you are referring to.
- Also, please, upload tha agenda on Sunday at the latest so that I have enough time to look at it.
- Tip - if questions arise before the meeting, you could put them in the agenda or ask them in mattermost. In that way I will have time to think about them and ask the lecturers for clarifications if needed.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Sufficient/Good

Feedback:

- You don't need to put everything in the notes. The point of the minutes is to remind you of the decisions you made. Things like who will do which task this week are definitely needed. However, you don't have to put "Check-In: How is everyone doing? (5 min) -  Everyone is doing great!" as you will most probably not need that information in the future. Another approach would be to just put all important things at the end :)

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Very Good/Excellent

Feedback:

- The chair's performance was very solid. Good job! You went through the whole agenda and asked for everyone's input and opinion while still being in the lead.
- However, you finished a little bit early with covering the agenda, so make sure to estimate the talking points better.
- Tip: you could put more talking points and if anything is left, discuss it in your separate meeting - better than wondering what to talk about in the last 10-15 minutes.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- You had a good discussion where everyone seemed involved. The atmosphere was constructive as the chair was asking for everyone's point of view.
- Kaan, you were a bit quiet compared to the others, so make sure to contribute more to the discussion in the future.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- You are definitely on the right track as you already had a lot of progress this week. Keep the same pace, and you will likely be done with the basic requirements in a few weeks.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Work distribution seems equal. Everyone said what they did and knew in detail what the project is about and how it works.
- Otte didn't do as much from what I understood, but he is definitely not far behind and had a good understanding about everything. 
- Tip: look at the rubrics! You weren't sure about the assessment of testing. In the end, you should know based on what criteria we will be grading you on :)
