# Meeting

Chair: Quinten

Minute: Sander

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Agenda is generally good, but you can make it even more detailed in order to make it perfect.
- Also, you talked about the formative feedback I gave you, but this was not in the agenda. You should have added it to make it more extensive.
- Agenda was added on time.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Notes are somewhat detailed, but the following thing can be improved:
    - You mentioned your bugs but there is no agreement on how you are planning to fix them. Who will do what?
- Also, I feel that some things are missing from your notes as there are not that much. 

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Chair was mostly in the lead, while leaving a lot of room for input from others.
- Chair was also following the agenda and covered everything in an appropriate amount of time.
- At some times though (mostly second half of the meeting), the lead was taken from the chair. For example, they weren't in the lead of distributing the tasks.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- As always, the atmosphere is really nice. Most of you are actively participating in the discussion and giving their opinions. Keep this up! :)


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Very Good

Feedback:

- You say that you now have all the basic requirements. I would suggest to go one more time through all if them and check if everything is there.
- If all the basic requirements are done, you should now focus on more of the extra features.
- You had a lot of progress since last time, so great job!
- As I said in the meeting, check the grading criteria for "Implemented features". You only get the full points for an extra features, if you add a meaningful extension to it.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Work distribution seems OK. Everyone said what they did, so I see that everyone is working on something.
- Looking at your lines of code, they are not that equal. Make sure that you are happy with the current contribution of everyone, and if issues occur - discuss it.  Keep in mind that some assignment rubrics grade you on that.
