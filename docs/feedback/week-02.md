# Meeting

Chair: Vilius
Minute: Kaan


#### Agenda

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Generally, you have to follow the agenda template (as you did) 
but if something is not relevant, feel free to omit it. 
For example, things that are 0 min shouldn't be there.
- Also, there are some talking points with an unachievable time. For example,
"Create Code of Conduct" has only 5 minutes allocated to it and "Discuss and 
Create Issues on GitLab" has 7, which is far too little.

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: Sufficient

- For a first meeting, this was a good start! However, the chair was a 
bit quiet at times and didn’t fully take the lead in guiding the discussion.
Quinten’s prior experience helped keep the conversation going, which was 
great to see. 
- In the future, I’d encourage the chair to take a more active 
role in leading the meeting—ensuring all topics are covered, suggesting ideas,
leaving space for contributions, and stepping in to fill silences when needed.
- Another thing to note is that there was quite a bit of time left after 
covering the agenda. For future meetings, it might be helpful to plan the 
timing a bit more realistically to make the most of the meeting.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- You took ownership of the meeting even though it was your first one, 
which was great to see! 
- The communication was also very good, and it showed that you've already
met beforehand. This certainly contributed to a constructive atmosphere, 
where everyone was heard. 

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Some of you have more experience than others, which naturally made you a 
bit more active in the discussion. In the future, it would be great to 
ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute.
