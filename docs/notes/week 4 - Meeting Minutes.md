# Meeting Notes
## Announcements by the TA
There are some deadlines approaching:
- The most important one is the buddycheck, this needs to be done by friday and is the only one that needs to be done
- Tasks and Planning
- Code Reviews

The last two are just checks on what we have done. For more info check brightspace.

## Talking Points
### Discuss Tasks and Planning part of the assesment design
#### Issue Creation
We have added labels, but our issues can sometimes be too big. We then talked about bug fixes when working on an issue, if it is part of your scope then fix it, if not then make a new issue for it.
  - Also clarify the issue acceptance criteria
#### Issue Description
We are good on this

#### Planning
- We need to make better use of milestones. Normally a milestone is 1 per week, in our case we probably have the current milestone of basic requirements done by the end of next week. But the weeks after that, have a weekly milestone, which will be a extra requirement per week, probably.
  - Markdown is also a milestone

#### Time Tracking
- We did not do anything on this. Note how much time you took on an issue when working on it. Also estimate the time it will take.
- We have decided to not use weights.
- (We do not need to add time tracking for the issues we have already done)

[If we want to accomplish the excellent criteria, we also need to follow the criteria of the lower levels]

### Creating big goals (Milestones)
This will just be the bonus features

### Implementation of tests
- First of all we need to split our client/scenes controllers into services.
  - This way they will be easier to test because it is kind of impossible to test controllers
  - This refactoring needs to be done by one person
  - From now on separate the logic into services
- Do more stuff while you are coding


### Websockets
We will use websockets for:
- Title changes,
- Deletion,
- Creation,
- Changing of contents (per 2 lines)

And use REST for manual refreshing

### Create issues next week
- Refractoring: Otte
- Websocket: Quinten
- Popup for exception/ alert: Villius

(The rest will be done friday)

## Extra notes
- Everyone needs to have at least 100 lines in the server-side, this can be done with for example:
  - A global exception handler
  - Extra requirement Collection

## Chair/ Minute-taker next meeting
- Chair: Otte
- Minute-taker: Ojas
