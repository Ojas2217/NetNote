## Refactoring:
We have to refactor **three classes** on the **client side**.
- Only the **client part** needs to be split up into:
    - **Business Logic**
    - **UI Components**
- Ojas and Villius will try to complete the refactoring.

### Plan:
- We will work on **Multi-Collections (4.2)** and **Live Language Switch (4.6)** side by side.
