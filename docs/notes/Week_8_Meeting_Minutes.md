# Meeting Week 8

## TA Announcements:
- **Around tuesday 21st January we will get an asessment on the total knockout criteria**

## Presentation of the App:
- **There are still bugs present which need to fixed**

## Issues to be created:
1. **Splitting up the server tests (Sander, Kaan)**, making sure the inferred tests are explicitly tested first
2. **Saving the content of a note when changing language (Vilius)**
3. **When the program starts the user should be able to select a language using icons (Vilius)**

## Bugs:
1. Switching languages still messes up the colours of the theme.
2. Search content doesn't switch theme.
3. Can't delete notes. (could have something to do with websockets)
4. The default collection does not show up when selecting a collection.
5. After changing the language, you can't add a new note.

## Side-notes
- We should make sure all of the basic requirements are finished before we even look at the "extra functionality"
---
## Plan:
- Kaan and Sander will try to get their server side lines by 1. Splitting up the test classes into a more basic class and the more advanced class.
                                                             2. Move the searching and filtering towards the server side.
- Vilius is going to try to add flags to the language menu.
- We have to make sure the navigation is logical and cosistent. (I think this is already the case)
- Sander is going to change the index of the searched word to include the note-title and line number
